# Power-BI-Project
In this project titled Sales Dashboard I had created an interactive report using Microsoft Power BI which includes certain pie charts and bar graphs to give an overview of the Company's operations and sales during each quarters of the year and the Company's performance for each State. All the information was tracked and worked out using the Orders and Details (csv) files and together collaborated using various tools of Power BI to create this interactive Dashboard.
Microsoft Power BI is an interactive data visualization software product developed by Microsoft with a primary focus on business intelligence. It is part of the Microsoft Power Platform. Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn various sources of data into static and interactive data visualizations. Data may be input by reading directly from a database, webpage, PDF, or structured files such as spreadsheets, CSV, XML, JSON, XLSX, and SharePoint.
Power BI provides cloud-based BI (business intelligence) services, known as "Power BI Services", along with a desktop-based interface, called "Power BI Desktop". It provides data warehouse capabilities including data preparation, data mining, and interactive dashboards.
